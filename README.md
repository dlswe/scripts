# scripts
My script collection

DOS batch, powershell and bash - mainly

removefiles.bat - DOS batch script to remove extraneous music files before importing into Roon library. Theory: the less files to read, the faster.

removefiles.ps1 - My first attempt at re-writing a DOS batch script to powershell. Mistakes time!

rooncleaner.ps1 - Sometimes things don't work out the way you want and an import into Roon leaves files unimported. This is trying to deal with that by ERASING the offending files. If you'd rather keep the files and try to save them, this is not for you.
